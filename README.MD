This program was developed as part of a university lab, to explore recursion.

The input to the program is a text file which defines a 2D array of characters of size 25x25 where:
“W” represents a wall
“ ” represents a path
“I” represents the entrance
“O” represents the exit.

The task defined by the lab was to develop a recursive program which can find a path to the end of the maze from the start.

## Notes

Please note, that this program was created by fleshing out a skeletal program given. This was provided to define the problem better, and did not include any method to solve the problem.

The source code is written as C, and provided in a Visual Studio project.
